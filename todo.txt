To do:
- add documentation for:
   shred
   patch
   diff
   vimdiff
- only print example page if command exists on the system? (use
  command -v) (then add flag to always show data, regardless of
  existence)
- less sometimes starts first line at middle or bottom of terminal,
  which is not very aesthetic (man somehow always handles this
  properly)
- write PKGBUILD
