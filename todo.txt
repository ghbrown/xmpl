To do:
- has noticable latency when CPU is governed (meaning it's a bit slow)
  - I already use a virtual file if possible to save IO, this is just
    caused by the poor performance of styler
  - performance could be improved by running operations in batch, ie
    call sed to style headers on the whole file at once, not a single
    line at a time
  - then run single pass of current approach just to detect code
    blocks (sed could work but is messy, perl is not an option)
- see if the check for blank lines at top and bottom can be obviated
  by injecting them into the temporary file that gets created (this
  would be one less rule for the actual example files to follow)
- change example files over to markdown
- add documentation for:
                        shred
                        patch
                        diff
                        vimdiff
- only print example page if command exists on the system? (use
  command -v) (then add flag to always show data, regardless of
  existence)
- less sometimes starts first line at middle or bottom of terminal,
  which is not very aesthetic (man somehow always handles this
  properly)
- write PKGBUILD
