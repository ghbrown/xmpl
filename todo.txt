To do:
- has noticable latency when CPU is governed (meaning it's a bit slow)
  - I already use a virtual file if possible to save IO, this is just
    caused by the poor performance of styler
  - performance could be improved by running operations in batch, ie
    call sed to style headers on the whole file at once, not a single
    line at a time
  - then run single pass of current approach just to detect code
    blocks (sed could work but is messy, perl is not an option)
- add documentation for:
                        shred
                        patch
                        diff
                        vimdiff
- only print example page if command exists on the system? (use
  command -v) (then add flag to always show data, regardless of
  existence)
- write PKGBUILD
