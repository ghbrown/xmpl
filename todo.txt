To do:
- add documentation for: touch, chmod, cat, tail, head, less, more
                         kill, killall, which, shred
                         patch, diff, vimdiff
- only print example page if command exists on the system? (will need
  to try-except call of command) (add a flag to always show data)
- think about using markdown and pandoc for everything
  - it is critical that the user be able to write their own documentation,
    so at best we'd have to transform the markdown to .txt during
    make all
- think about using rich for readability
  - again, how could the user write docs that looked as good as ours
- write PKGBUILD
