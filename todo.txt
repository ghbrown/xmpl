To do:
- change over all pages to markdown
- see if the check for blank lines at top and bottom can be obviated
  by injecting them into the temporary file that gets created (this
  would be one less rule for the actual example files to follow)
- change example files over to markdown
- add documentation for:
                        shred
                        patch
                        diff
                        vimdiff
- only print example page if command exists on the system? (use
  command -v) (then add flag to always show data, regardless of
  existence)
- less sometimes starts first line at middle or bottom of terminal,
  which is not very aesthetic (man somehow always handles this
  properly)
- write PKGBUILD
