pop entry from directory stack
(see also: pushd, dirs)

-- Example 1 --
pop top entry from directory stack, moving to the next directory
  popd

-- Notes --
in practice, usage of popd in a workflow often looks like
  cd ~/foo/bar
  pushd /usr/lib  # perhaps to examine available libraries
  popd            # return to ~/foo/bar by popping /usr/lib from stack
