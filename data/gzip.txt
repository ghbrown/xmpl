compress or expand files

-- Example 1 --
compress foo.txt (producing foo.txt.gz); compression happens in place,
so foo.txt will not remain after compression
  gzip foo.txt

-- Example 2 --
decompress foo.txt.gz (producing foo.txt); decompression happens in
place, so foo.txt.gz will not remain after compression
  gzip -d foo.txt.gz

-- Example 3 --
compress foo.txt to bar.txt.gz using redirect to stdout (-c); foo.txt
is left unchanged (useful for compressing file to different location)
 gzip -c foo.txt > bar.txt.gz
