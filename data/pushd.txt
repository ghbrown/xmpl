add to directory stack
(see also: popd, dirs)

-- Example 1 --
add current directory to directory stack while changing to `/usr/bin`
  pushd /usr/bin

-- Notes --
in practice, usage of pushd in a workflow often looks like
  cd ~/foo/bar
  pushd /usr/lib  # perhaps to examine available libraries
  popd            # return to ~/foo/bar by popping /usr/lib from stack
