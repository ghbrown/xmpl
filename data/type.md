show how argument would be interpreted as a command
(see also: `command`)

# Example 1
display how `gcc` would be interpreted if used as a command (effectively showing its path/location on the system)
```
type gcc
```

# Notes
`type` can also detect aliases, in which case it prints the command pointed to by the alias (but not necessarily its path)
