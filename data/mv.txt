move/rename files and directories

-- Example 1 --
rename foo.txt to bar.txt
  mv foo.txt bar.txt

-- Example 2 --
move foo.txt to directory bar/; directory baz must exist, if it does
not the foo.txt file will be renamed to bar
(the following are equivalent if directory bar/ exists)
  mv foo.txt bar
  mv foo.txt bar/foo.txt

-- Example 3 --
move multiple files (foo.txt and foo.c) to a directory (bar/)
  mv foo.txt foo.c bar

-- Example 4 --
move contents of foo/ to bar/ while being interactively (-i) prompted
to overwrite existing files and directories
  mv -i foo/* bar

-- Example 5 --
move contents of foo/ to bar/, forcefully (-f) overwriting existing
files of the same name
  mv -f foo/* bar
