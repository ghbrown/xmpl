execute or view interpretation of command
(see also: type)

-- Example 1 --
display how gcc would be interpreted if used as a command (effectively
showing its path/location on the system)
  command -v gcc

-- Example 2 --
execute the Python interpreter
  command python

-- Notes --
command can also detect aliases, in which case it prints the command
pointed to by the alias (but not necessarily its path)
